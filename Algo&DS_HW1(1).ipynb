The second for loop. starting at line 5, runs from j = 0 to j = M-1, meaning that this loop runs M number of times. Due to this, the time complexity of this loop is O(M). Lastly, due to these two for loops being separate, the time complexity of the whole code snippit is the sum of the time complexities of the two loops, making the time complexity of this snippit O(N + M)."

In the inner for loop, the loop starts at t = 2, where it is multiplied by 2 (t= t * 2) until it equals n. So, the time complexity of the inner loop is O(logn) as t is growing exponentially by 2.
